# Chase-MDAnalysis-SmallGTPase-Suite
This is a library of tools I am builidng to analyze SmallGTPase orientation dynamics with the MDAnalysis Python Library. While I would eventually like to use more of my own tools, for now this library is more than good enough.


I have several goals in mind with this repository
# 1. Store code I have written for Analyzing Small GTPase MD Trajectories
I want to store all the code I have written as well as keep a detailed history of each change I have made, in case I make a mistake or would like to return to a previous iteration. This is part of a larger goal of organizing my code, and learning to write like a software engineer.
# 2. I want to make some of this stuff publicly available so that others might use it for their own projects, and give me some hopefully constructive criticism on my writing style and make suggestions

# 3. Lastly I want to learn to use GitHub, which is a valuable tool for organizing a codebase


I will eventually devise some methods of allowing others to edit this code as well, and maybe make some sort way other people can be involved so that I am not the only one editing it.
